#  DESCRIPTION 
This ETL pipeline effectively preprocesses both numerical and categorical features, handling missing values, scaling numerical data, and encoding categorical data. The combined preprocessing steps are applied in a seamless manner using scikit-learn's Pipeline and ColumnTransformer. The final output is a clean, transformed dataset saved to a new CSV file, ready for further analysis or modeling.
