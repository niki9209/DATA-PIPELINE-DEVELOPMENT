This ETL pipeline effectively preprocesses both numerical and categorical features, handling missing values, scaling numerical data, and encoding categorical data. The combined preprocessing steps are applied in a seamless manner using scikit-learn's Pipeline and ColumnTransformer. The final output is a clean, transformed dataset saved to a new CSV file, ready for further analysis or modeling.
This pipeline ensures that the data is standardized and formatted correctly, making it suitable for use in machine learning models and providing a streamlined approach for data preprocessing and transformation.
